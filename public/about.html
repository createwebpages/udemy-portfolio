<h1>About PBS KIDS</h1>
<p>All children deserve the chance to reach their full potential. That’s why PBS KIDS aims to improve educational outcomes for young children across America. We are committed to supporting the entire ecosystem in which children learn, which relies on their parents, caregivers and teachers — as well as local organizations that support education, including PBS member stations. This community-based approach is grounded in research that shows that when the adults in their lives are engaged, kids’ learning outcomes improve.

  PBS’ nearly 350 member stations are locally owned and operated, and are dedicated to meeting the needs of their communities. PBS stations engage families and educators through high-quality content — and so much more. From outreach initiatives to local education programs, stations are trusted education partners in their communities.</p>

  <h1> Work of PBS KIDS</h1>
<p>Young children need a variety of academic and social-emotional skills to succeed inside and outside the classroom. That’s why PBS KIDS has a whole-child approach to preparing children for kindergarten, offering media that supports key developmental areas — from communication and critical thinking skills to literacy and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) learning.

  When it comes to developing shows and digital experiences for children, PBS KIDS starts with their needs, then works with advisors and award-wining producers to develop content that addresses them. Throughout the process, research ensures that PBS KIDS shows, games and activities are developmentally appropriate, safe and effective learning tools.</p>

  <h1> Impact of PBS KIDS </h1>
<p>Because every child deserves access to high-quality educational opportunities, PBS KIDS is available for free on TV, across digital platforms and in communities across America. Our mission is to spark learning for all kids – especially those who need the most support. Research demonstrates that PBS KIDS content moves the needle in helping children build the skills they need to succeed in school and life — with kids in low-income communities often making the greatest gains.</p>
